Dear [Company Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out on behalf of the Calgary Indigenous STEAM Students Association (CISSA) at the University of Calgary, and we are excited to explore the possibility of partnering with [Company Name] as a sponsor for our club.

The mission of CISSA is to promote Indigenous engagement in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) fields while fostering a supportive campus community and providing valuable professional development opportunities for our members.

We have developed three distinct sponsorship tiers, each offering unique benefits detailed in the attached Sponsorship Package attached. By supporting CISSA, your company stands to gain:
1. Enhanced Visibility: Showcase your company's current opportunities and offerings at our sponsored events, allowing you to reach and connect with talented Indigenous and non-Indigenous students actively seeking internships or graduation opportunities.
2. Emphasis on Diversity and Inclusivity: Through your involvement with CISSA, you can actively participate in cultural enhancement initiatives, showcasing your dedication to fostering diversity and inclusivity within the STEAM industry.

We firmly believe that a collaboration between [Company Name] and CISSA will not only make a meaningful impact on promoting Indigenous representation in STEAM but also create a positive and lasting impression on the future generation of professionals.

Kindly refer to the attached Sponsorship Package for more detailed information. 

We would be delighted to further discuss our sponsorship opportunities and answer any inquiries you may have.
Thank you for considering our proposal. We eagerly await your response and the potential to form a mutually beneficial partnership with [Company Name].

Sincerely,
